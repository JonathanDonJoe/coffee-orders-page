# Coffee Orders

1. draw all the email addresses associated with the coffee orders to the page in a list
2. when you click a coffee order, draw the details of the order to another part of the page
3. store the coffee data in localStorage
4. load the coffee data when the page loads, only retrieving it if there is no data in localStorage
5. add links with filtering by the first letter of the email (or coffee order, your choice)
that’s all for now, thanks y’all
